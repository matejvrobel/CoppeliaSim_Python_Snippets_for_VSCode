# CoppeliaSim Python Snippets for VSCode

This repository contains a CoppeliaSim add-on that automatically exports all available CoppeliaSim API functions and constants as **Python snippets for Visual Studio Code**.  
With these snippets, you get autocomplete-like suggestions when coding against the Remote API in Python.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Generates `.code-snippets` file for VSCode.
- Includes both **functions** (e.g. `sim.setObjectPosition(...)`) and **constants** (e.g. `sim.handle_world`).
- Snippets are automatically derived from the official CoppeliaSim API â†’ always up-to-date with your simulator version.
- Works out of the box in **Python development** inside VSCode.
